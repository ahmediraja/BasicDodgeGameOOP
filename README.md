# BasicDodgeGameOOP
This is a small project I worked on to learn Object Oriented Programming.
I did not spend too much time on this. However, in the future, I may come back to this if I am bored.

To play the minigame, use you mouse to dodge the balls falling from the top.

This can be used as a basic example when introducing new people to OOP, or classes for that matter.
